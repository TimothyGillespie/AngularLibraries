#Angular Libraries

This repository contains Angular2 libraries which are hosted under the @tgillespie namespace on npm along with a showcase.

## Overview

### @tgillespie/ngx-youtube-player
A component for embedding the YouTube Player and controlling it via the [YouTube iFrame API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference).

It makes the iFrame API and player instance available via services and the component attribute. Alternatively, the API and Player instances can be managed with custom services.

Demo and npm package are coming soon.
